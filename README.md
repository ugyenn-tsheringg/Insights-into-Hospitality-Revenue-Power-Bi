## üìå Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India and has been in the hospitality industry for 20 years. Due to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective decision-making, they are losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel category.

The managing director aims to incorporate **Business and Data Intelligence** to address these challenges. Without an in-house analytics team, the revenue management team has hired a third-party service provider to derive insights from historical data.
